# Project Purpose

This project is an About Me for myself, Matthew O'Dell. 

Throughout the About Me, one is able to view my interests and the things I enjoy.

## Navigation Bar

This is where I learned how to create a Nav Bar and add it into my project. 

I used [W3Schools.com] in order to make it have a responsive drop down menu.


## Biography

The biography gives the viewer an idea of my goals and interests, including what I do in my free time.

Here, I learned how to write out centered text in a way that is responsive. 


## Hobbies

Next, the hobbies section shows of my hobbies in a list format, making it simple to understand.

In this section I learned how to create a centered list that is responsive.

## Gallery

In the Gallery, viewers are able to see imagery for some of the things that I like. 

In this case, my trip to Switzerland is shown through the three photos in the Gallery.

It is here in this section that I learned skills on how to import images while making them responsive. 

## Video

Towards the middle, there is a video that viewers can watch that shows my pets.

It was here that I learned how to import and scale a video onto a web page. 

## CSS Hover Effects (Blog Post)

This blog post includes my findings when researching the topic that is CSS Hover Effects. I quite enjoyed researching this. I used [corelangs.com], [w3schools.com], and [freefrontend.com].

## Contact Us

If desired, viewers of the project can get in touch with me via the form in the Contact Me section.

In this section, I learned how to create and stlye a form on a webpage.
