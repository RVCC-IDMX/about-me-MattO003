                <p>Currently, I aspire to become a cybersecurity professional.</p>
                <p>As of right now, I am taking quite a few classes that will hopefully help me to achieve that aspiration.
                </p>
                <p>This includes Web Development, Database Dev and Design, and Computer Science.</p>
                <p>That also means that I'm currently learning THREE different programming languages.</p>
                <p>1. HTML - In my Web Development class</p>
                <p>2. SQL - In my Database Development and Design class</p>
                <p>3. JAVA - In my Computer Science class</p>
                <p>Thankfully, it hasn't been too bad.</p>
                <p>Right now, my favorite way to work is...</p>
                <p>in the morning, so I know I have ample time to complete my tasks.</p>
                <p>However, this does mean that I actually have to wake up, which is probably the hardest part.</p>
                <p>Although, once I'm done I have the rest of the day to relax.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I like to...</p>
                <p>Hang out with friends, use my PC, or watch TV.</p>
                <p>Recently, I've been watching A LOT of Castle.</p>
                <p>School and work combined don't give me much free time, so I'm excited for the summer.</p>

        <h2>CSS Hover Effects</h2>

        <div>

            <p>My topic of choice is CSS Hover effects, and it's something that I've actually found very interesting while going into research. Basically, 
                These effects allow for images to take on a new life. Hover effects add animation through changes of the image, whether it be through adding text, 
                transperency, shadows, patterns, and much more!"</p>

            <p>First off, lets start with text. There is many ways to add text onto an image. The first way we'll talk about is by adding in a fade in text 
                animation. When hovering over the specified image, one can introduce a blanket layer over the image that reveals some text with it. Next, text can be added
                in with a slide in layer, again bringing text with it. This can be done by sliding in the layer from the top, bottom, or sides. A text overlay can be good for 
                describing images, as the text can go into detail on what the image is about, where it's located, or what it's showing.
            </p>

            <p>Next, there is transperency.</p>

            <p>Transperency in images allows for a neat effect when a cursor is hovering on top. The transperency of an image might drop or even possibly 
                increase depending on the default state of the image. This could be useful for fading images in web pages.</p>

            <p>Another pretty cool effect is shadows. Shadow effects with images can create a sense of depth in the web page. When hovering over an image, 
                the effect of a shadow can make it so that the image is pertruding from the page, making it so that there are shadows underneath where it stands.</p>

            <p>The last effect I'll talk about is patterns, which can be placed behind an image to give a smooth animation once a cursor it placed over it. By providing patterns behind the image,
                the patterns can then reveal themselves more fully once the animation begins.
            </p>

            <p>Hover effects are easy to implement and only require HTML and CSS to work. I believe that the text implementation is probably the most useful way 
                to use hover effects, considering more information can be given to a viewer.
            </p>

            <p>To use these effects, a container class must be created with a width and position. Then, create an overlay class with 
                a transition and make sure to set the opacity to zero. This way, the overlay won't show up unless the opacity is raised.
                Next, the overlay must be visualized by using </p>

            <p>.container:hover .overlay { opacity: 1; }</p>

            <p>This way, the overlay will now show up when a cursor is placed over the image.</p>

            <p>I was able to create this small article with the help of these websites.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.corelangs.com/css/box/hover.html" style="font-weight:bold">Core Langs</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://freefrontend.com/css-hover-effects/" style="font-weight:bold">Free Frontend</a></p>

            <p>Lastly, here is an example of an image with a text overlay</p>

            <div class="container">
                <img src="img/landscape-640w.JPG" alt="A landscape picture in Switzerland." class="image">
                <div class="overlay">
                  <div class="text">Switzerland</div>
                </div>
              </div>
